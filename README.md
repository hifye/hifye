## Hey, I’m Higor <img src="assets/blob-wave.gif" width="30" alt="waveEmoji"> 
 
 I’m a software developer based in Brazil, focused on backend development and building well-structured APIs. 
 I enjoy turning ideas into working systems — clean, scalable, and easy to reason about. 
 If something sparks my curiosity, I’ll usually dive deep, break it apart, and build my own version to truly understand how it works. 
 My main stack revolves around **C#, .NET, REST APIs, and application architecture**. I care a lot about **clean code, separation of concerns, and long-term maintainability**.
